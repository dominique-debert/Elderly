# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Helpy frontend application from DaisyUI to shadcn/ui component library. The migration aims to modernize the UI components while maintaining existing functionality and improving developer experience with better TypeScript support and customization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace DaisyUI with shadcn/ui, so that I can have better TypeScript support, more customizable components, and a more modern UI foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use shadcn/ui components instead of DaisyUI components
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing UI functionality SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL maintain the same visual design and user experience
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the build process SHALL successfully compile without DaisyUI dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing component functionality, so that users experience no disruption in the application's behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are migrated THEN all interactive elements SHALL function identically to the original implementation
2. WHEN forms are migrated THEN all form validation and submission SHALL work as before
3. WHEN navigation components are migrated THEN all routing and navigation SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN modal and dialog components are migrated THEN they SHALL maintain the same behavior and accessibility features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure shadcn/ui properly, so that the component library integrates seamlessly with the existing Vite + React + TypeScript setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shadcn/ui is installed THEN it SHALL be properly configured with Tailwind CSS
2. WHEN shadcn/ui is installed THEN the components.json configuration SHALL be set up correctly
3. WHEN shadcn/ui is installed THEN the TypeScript configuration SHALL support the new component imports
4. WHEN shadcn/ui is installed THEN the build process SHALL optimize the bundle size appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all component imports and usage, so that the application uses shadcn/ui components throughout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component imports are updated THEN all DaisyUI component references SHALL be replaced with shadcn/ui equivalents
2. WHEN component props are updated THEN they SHALL match the shadcn/ui component API
3. WHEN styling is updated THEN custom CSS classes SHALL be compatible with shadcn/ui theming
4. WHEN the update is complete THEN no DaisyUI imports SHALL remain in the codebase

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain consistent theming and styling, so that the application's visual identity remains cohesive after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN theming is configured THEN the color palette SHALL match the existing design system
2. WHEN theming is configured THEN typography styles SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN theming is configured THEN spacing and layout SHALL maintain the current design
4. WHEN dark/light mode exists THEN it SHALL continue to function with shadcn/ui theming

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all pages and components are properly migrated, so that no part of the application is left using the old component library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are migrated THEN LoginPage, SignupPage, Homepage, AdminPage, ProfilePage, WellnessPage, and NotFoundPage SHALL use shadcn/ui components
2. WHEN UI components are migrated THEN all components in the components directory SHALL use shadcn/ui
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no DaisyUI classes SHALL remain in the HTML/JSX
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the package.json SHALL not include DaisyUI as a dependency
